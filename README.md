# GameSnakeEmbedded

This project implements a classic snake game in C using a NUCLEO-F103RB ST board. For the graphical interface, an LED matrix was built.

Code basic structure was created with STM32CubeMX application, thus using ST HAL lib, and STM32CubeIDE toolchain is used.

Code from the following repo (developed by @Patrickalvares and I) was (re)used for the game logic:
